Network Topology
----------------

Question : 6 Devices are arranged in a mesh topology.
		i. number of cables needed ?
		ii. number of ports for each devices needed ?
		iii. number of ports in the entire network?

Ans:

Mesh toplogy connect each node individually.

So 6 devices mean 5 others devices to connect.
So each devices will have 5 ports.
So the entire network will have 6x5 = 30ports.

but for the number of cables,
it seems it need 6x5 = 30cables But
it dont need 30cables Because the cable to A to B and the cable to B to A will be the same.
So we can consider there are 1 cable save for each 2 ports.
So we only need 30/2 = 15cables.

i. number of cables needed = 15
ii. number of ports for each devices needed = 5
iii. number of ports in the entire network = 30
