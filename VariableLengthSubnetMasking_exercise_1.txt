Problem : Subnet 192.168.10.0 /24 to Address the network of 20Users,Another 20Users and 60Users networks Connected by 3Routers in Trio.

Answer :

First we gotta know how many networks we have here.
20 , 20 , 60 users networks mean 3 networks.
Trio Connection of these three networks with a router mean 3 another networks with Duo IP addresses.
So we have 6networks.

For the hosts(IP Addresses), we have 20Users , 20Users , 60Users , 2Hosts for each Router Connections.

For 60Users network, we gonna preserve 20(111100,6bits) 6 Zeros from the right.
The Subnet mask : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
The Subnet Generator : 64 , Octect Position: 4

The Network range for 60Users is : 192.168.10.0 - 192.168.10.63 /26


For 20Users network, we gonna preserve 20(10100,5bits) 5 Zeros from the right.
The Subnet mask : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
The Subnet Generator : 32 , Octect Position: 4

The Network range for 20Users is :192.168.10.64 - 192.168.10.95 /27


For 20Users network, we gonna preserve 20(10100,5bits) 5 Zeros from the right.
The Subnet mask : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
The Subnet Generator : 32 , Octect Position: 4

The Network range for 20Users is :192.168.10.96 - 192.168.10.127 /27


For Router Duo network, we gonna preserve 2(10,2bits) 2 Zeros from the right.
The Subnet mask : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100
The Subnet Generator : 4 , Octect Position: 4

The Network range for 1st Router is :192.168.10.128 - 192.168.10.131 /30
The Network range for 2nd Router is :192.168.10.132 - 192.168.10.135 /30
The Network range for 3rd Router is :192.168.10.136 - 192.168.10.139 /30
