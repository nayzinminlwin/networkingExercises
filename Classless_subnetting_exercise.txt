Problem : Subnet the ip 216.21.5.0 into 31 hosts in each subnets.

Answer : 

216.21.5.0 is a Class C Network.
Default Subnet Mask is 255.255.255.0
Default Subnet Mask in binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

Num of Host : 31(11111,5Bits)
So gonna preserve 5bits starting from right,
Subnet mask in binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
Subnet mask : 255.255.255.224 or /27 (why /27 ? Coz we have 27 Ones in our subnet mask)
From right to left, the first 1 we encounter is the Subnet Generator,
so here we encounter 1 at the 6th place from the right.So 2^6 = 32.
Subnet Generator : 32
The position of Sub Generator is the Octect Number, which isnt 1 or 2 or 3. So,
Octect : 4

Now we gonna write down the start of each subnets,
216.21.5.0
216.21.5.32
216.21.5.64
216.21.5.96
216.21.5.128
216.21.5.160

So the subnets are - 
216.21.5.0 - 216.21.5.31,
216.21.5.32 - 216.21.5.63,
216.21.5.64 - 216.21.5.95,
216.21.5.96 - 216.21.5.127,
216.21.5.128 - 216.21.5.159,
216.21.5.160 -  and so on

Ps. 
The first ip address is the network address and last ip address is the broadcast address.
So they cant be assigned as a host.
eg . 
216.21.5.0 is the network address and 216.21.5.31 is the broadcast address.
So , From 216.21.5.1 to 216.21.5.30 are the only available networks in first subnet.
