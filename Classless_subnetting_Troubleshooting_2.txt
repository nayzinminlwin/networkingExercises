Problem : A computer with ip 172.15.68.65; Subnet Mask:255.255.255.240; Default GateWay : 172.15.68.62 is having problem with connecting 
the router Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 with ip 172.15.68.62; Subnet Mask:255.255.255.240 with a SWITCH.

Answer :

We gonna connect a pc and a router with the help of a SWITCH ; which mean the host ip addresses must be in the same network(subnet range).
The Subnet Mask is 255.255.255.240
in Binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000

Subnet Generator : 16

Subnet ranges are 
172.15.68.0 - 172.15.68.15
172.15.68.16 - 172.15.68.31
172.15.68.32 - 172.15.68.47
172.15.68.48 - 172.15.68.63 <-- Router IP Address
172.15.68.64 - 172.15.68.79 <-- PC IP Address
and so on . . . 

The Default Gateway of PC is True to the Router.
But PC and Router are in different networks so we should reassign the PC IP Address to 172.15.68.60.

Now Computer is with ip 172.15.68.60; Subnet Mask:255.255.255.240; Default GateWay : 172.15.68.62 is CONNECTED TO
Router GigaEthernet0/0 ip 172.15.68.62; SubnetMask : 255.255.255.240;
