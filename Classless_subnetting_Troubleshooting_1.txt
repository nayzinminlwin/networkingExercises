Problem : A computer with 192.168.1.127 with 255.255.255.224 is having problem with connecting other pcs.Solve this.

Answer :

Lets see the Class of the ip address. 192.168.1.127, A Class C Network.
The classless subnet mask is 255.255.255.224.
In Binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000

So the Subnet Generator is 32.
Octect Position is 4.

Subnet Ranges are

192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.31
192.168.1.32 - 192.168.1.63
192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.95
192.168.1.96 - 192.168.1.127 <--- (Given IP of the PC)
192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.159
192.168.1.160 - 192.168.1.191
and so on

The given ip address to the PC is 192.168.1.127,the broadcast address of the network which cant assing to a host.
So, we should reassign the ip address of the PC to 192.168.1.126.So it will work perfectly.
