Problem : Subnet the ip 150.15.0.0 into 500 hosts in each subnets.

Answer : 
150.15.0.0 is the Class B Network.
So the Default Subnet Mask is 255.255.0.0
in Binary : 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000

Num of Host : 500 (111110100,9Bits)
Preserving 9spcaes from the right.
new subnet mask : 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000

Subnet Generator : 2
Octect : 3

the new subnet mask is : 255.255.254.0 or /23

So the subnet mask are 

150.15.0.0 - 150.15.1.255
150.15.2.0 - 150.15.3.255
150.15.4.0 - 150.15.5.255
150.15.6.0 - 150.15.7.255
150.15.8.0 - 150.15.9.255
and so on . . .

in the class B Network the first 2 octect are not changing.
So to count the number of hosts and networks available, we gonna count number of Preserved 0 for Host and number of 1 for network.
Here , Number of Preserved 0 is up to 9 from the right, so it is 2^9. So we will be having 512Hosts(ip Addresses) per Network.
Then , Number of 1 Remaining is 7, so it is 2^7. So we will be having 128Subnets(Networks).
